# Logistics Lab - Task 1

Definition: "Jump" refers to a movement between machines that carries no payload

## How to run / where to find stuff

`validations.py` reads all files beginning with "schedule" and prints score.  
All relevant python files to create schedules are in `tests/`.  
Library with useful helper functions can be imported within that folder using `from utils import lib`, support for pypy can be reached by swapping to `from utils import libpypy as lib`.  
`write_history.py` can be used to print a history generated by the given algorithms into the format required by `validations.py`. The format used by the algorithms is concerned by moves: `(vehicle_id, start_pos, end_pos, carrying)` in which carrying is 1 if the vehicle is currently carrying a payload and 0 if it is jumping.

## 1 Vehicle

`lower_bound_test.py` calculates a lower bound for solutions.  
`longest_first.py` implements greedy algorithm that evaluates heuristic for current point.  
`full_depth_first.py` implements depth first search in which children nodes are sorted by the same heuristic.  
`full_depth_first_threading.py` and `full_depth_first_mp.py` implement multithreading and multiprocessing of the depth first search, multithreading seems to be more performant.  
`start_with_first_jump.py` assumes that a path is optimal up until first jump, as it only contains actually needed movements. The path after can be optimized quicker using a depth first search as the recursion depth is much lower. The algorithm requires a previous solution to build upon, which is found using `full_depth_first_threading.py` in the current case.

### Current solution

`full_depth_first_threading.py` finds solution with score 16200.6507 after 115 seconds  
taking solution, put history into file  
`start_with_first_jump.py` refines solution to score 16156.79 after 172 seconds  

Best solution after 287 seconds â‰™ 4 minutes 47 seconds  

`one_vehicle_combined.py` finds best solution after 6.5 minutes  

`five_vehicles_dfs_threading.py` finds solution with score 3261.29 after  seconds  
`start_with_first_jump_five.py` build on existing solution, finds solution 3259.18 after 1104 seconds (18.5 minutes), nothing happens for at least 14722 seconds (4 hours 5 minutes)  

### lower bound

First approach:  
only sum up all transport jobs, value: 15049.49

Second approach:  
also calculate how many jumps are needed, value: 1107.19  
Needed jumps are found by seeing which machines have more outgoing transport demands than incoming demands and the other way around. This way the shortest possibility to connect all machines with more incoming demands to the machines with more outgoing demands can be found using a depth first search.  
Can be understood as what paths need to be added to the graph in order for a eularian path to exist.  
added to first approach: 16156.68

Approach for multiple vehicles:  
sum of transport jobs divided by number of vehicles  
value for 5 vehicles: 3009.9, value for 10 vehicles: 1504.95  
jumps analogous to one vehicle, searching for connections that need to be added for five or 10 parallel eularian paths, distance divided by number of vehicles  
value for 5 vehicles: 215.34, value for 10 vehicles: 99.36  

sum for 5 vehicles: 3225.24, value for 10 vehicles: 1604.31
